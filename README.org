Experimental library for [[https://fennel-lang.org/][Fennel]] language, that adds many functions from [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]]'s standard library.
This is not a one to one port of Clojure =core=, because many Clojure functions require certain guarantees, like immutability of the underlying data structures, or laziness.
Therefore some names were changed, but they should be still recognizable, and certain functions were altered to better suit the domain.

Even though it is project is experimental, the goals of this project are:

- Have a self contained library, with no dependencies, that provides a set of useful functions from Clojure =core=,
- Be close to the platform, e.g. implement functions in a way that is efficient to use in Lua VM,
- Be well documented library, with good test coverage.

Documentation is autogenerated with [[https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fenneldoc][Fenneldoc]] and can be found [[https://gitlab.com/andreyorst/fennel-cljlib/-/tree/master/doc][here]].
